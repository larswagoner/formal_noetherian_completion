  # Corollary 10.25
  Let `A` be a ring, `I` an ideal of `A`, `M` an `A`-module, `(Mₙ)` an
  `I`-filtration of `M`. Suppose `A` is complote in the `I`-topology
  and that `M` is Hausdorff in its filtration topology (i.e. `⋂ₙ Mₙ = 0`).
  Suppose also that `G(M)` is a Noetherian `G(A)`-module.
  Then `M` is Noetherian `A`-module.
