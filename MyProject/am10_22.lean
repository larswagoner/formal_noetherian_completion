  # Proposition 10.22
  Let `A` be a Noetherian ring and `a` an ideal of `A`. Then
  i) `Gₐ(A)` is Noetherian.
  ii) `Gₐ(A)` and `Gₐ(Â)` are isomorphic as graded rings.
  iii) If `M` is a finitely-generated `A`-module and `(Mₙ)` is a stable `a`-filtration of `M`,
      then `G(M)` is a finitely-generated graded `Gₐ(A)`-module.

/- Notes for 10.22.i 
Instead of directly following the approach in AM (which relies on an equality involving G(A) which I think will be annoying to make type check), very open for this option if it ends up being easy. I propose the following approach: 

1. Since I is an ideal of a noetherian ring, it is finitely generated, with generating set S : Finset A. 
2. Consider the polynomial ring B = A/I [{x_s}_{s∈ S}], with indeterminates indexed by S. This ring is noetherian since A/I is (quotient) and by Hilberts basis theorem
3. For G(A) to be noetherian, it suffices to give a map B → AssociatedGradedRing I that is a homomorphism and surjective. Such a map is given by sending A/I to the first component I^0/I^1 = A/I, and each variable to the corresponding image of the generator s in the second component I/I^2. 

Progress so far:
The proof is outlined. 
1. Map of scalars: A/I →+* G(A). On paper, we should get this for free with DirectSum.ofZeroRingHom. But the domain for that result needs to be (GradedPiece (CanonicalFiltration I) 0), which is equal to A/I, but one cant just rewrite via this equality. So I have the scalar map as a composition A/I →+* (GradedPiece (CanonicalFiltration I) 0) →+* G(A). Whats missing is the first map, multiplication might be annoying?
2. Map of variables. Mathematically this would be done as so: send a generator s to its equivalence class in I/I^2, then apply the canonical map to end up in G(A) (DirectSum.of (GradedPiece (CanonicalFiltration I)) 1  should work i think)
3. Surjectivity: map needs to be defined first. This will basically amount to proving the equality stated in AM
