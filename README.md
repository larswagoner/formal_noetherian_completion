# Repository Structure

The lean files can be found in the MyProject directory, which contains subdirectories with definitions of the necessary mathematical objects (associated graded ring, completions, filtrations, graded star ring) to prove the main theorem, as well as several theorems about these objects. There are also files corresponding to each of the results in Atiyah-Macdonald necessary to prove the main theorem.
