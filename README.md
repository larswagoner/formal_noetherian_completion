# Repository Structure

The lean files can be found in the MyProject directory, which contains subdirectories with definitions of and results about the mathematical objects (associated graded ring, completions, filtrations, graded star ring) used to prove the main theorem (am10_26.lean). There are also files corresponding to each of the results in Atiyah-Macdonald used to prove the main theorem.
