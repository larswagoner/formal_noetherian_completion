Sketch
- [ ] See which results are already in mathlib
- [ ] summarize statements in ordered part of proof_skeleton.md. To have a quick overview. 
- [X] Prove 7.6 from 7.5


Set up
- [X] Create repository + files
- [X] Add outline 
- [X] Share repo 


- [ ] maybe outline proof of main theorem to see how things are used
- [ ] define graded module.
- [ ] verify adic_completion statements are actually true. worst case replace IsAdicComplete with IsReallyAdicComplete where necessary
- [ ] try to find easy proofs to fill in
- [ ] think about definitions of AssociatedGraded stuff. 
- [ ] in associated stuff make sure the definitions inherit the correct properties naturally.
